# Signing

Two identities, one per kind of build:

- **Releases** are signed by CI with the **Developer ID Application** identity of team `HS26J3YA63`,
  then notarized — the same identity and flow as Pointa. It lives only in the release workflow's
  secrets; see [release.md](release.md#one-time-setup).
- **Local dev builds** sign with a **stable self-signed identity** called `Blitz Self-Signed`.
  Keeping the _same_ identity on every build is what makes macOS remember the Accessibility
  permission across rebuilds — ad-hoc signing changes every build and macOS forgets the grant.

You create the self-signed identity **once**.

## 1. Create the `Blitz Self-Signed` identity (once)

Run these in a terminal. They generate a self-signed code-signing certificate and import it into your
login keychain:

```sh
# Generate a self-signed code-signing cert (10-year, codeSigning use).
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 3650 \
  -keyout /tmp/tc-key.pem -out /tmp/tc-cert.pem \
  -subj "/CN=Blitz Self-Signed" \
  -addext "basicConstraints=critical,CA:false" \
  -addext "keyUsage=critical,digitalSignature" \
  -addext "extendedKeyUsage=critical,codeSigning"

# Bundle it as a .p12 (the non-empty password keeps `security import` happy).
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey /tmp/tc-key.pem -in /tmp/tc-cert.pem \
  -name "Blitz Self-Signed" -out /tmp/tc.p12 -passout pass:blitz

# Import into the login keychain so codesign can use it without prompting.
security import /tmp/tc.p12 -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db \
  -P blitz -A -T /usr/bin/codesign

rm -f /tmp/tc-key.pem /tmp/tc-cert.pem /tmp/tc.p12
```

Verify it's there:

```sh
security find-identity -p codesigning | grep "Blitz Self-Signed"
```

Now local builds (Xcode, VS Code F5, `xcodebuild`) sign with it, and you grant Accessibility once.

## Hardened runtime

**Release only**, on both targets: `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME: YES`, which notarization requires. Debug
must stay without it — hardened runtime turns on library validation, and Xcode's
`Blitz Dev.debug.dylib` is refused at launch because a self-signed identity carries no Team ID for
the loader to match. The flag is not part of the designated requirement, so turning it on costs no
Accessibility grant. Each entitlement in `Blitz/Blitz.entitlements` earns its place:

| Entitlement | Without it |
| --- | --- |
| `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` | JavaScriptCore cannot JIT, and every extension command runs on the interpreter |
| `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` | Every Apple event is refused with `-1743` and no prompt — Get Info, the Finder selection an extension reads, and the System Events–driven system actions all die silently |
| `com.apple.security.device.camera` | The camera prompt never appears and access resolves as denied |
| `com.apple.security.personal-information.calendars` | `requestFullAccessToEvents()` returns `false` in milliseconds with no dialog, and Blitz never appears under System Settings › Calendars |

**A usage string is not enough under the hardened runtime.** `tccd` checks the matching entitlement
*before* it prompts, and without it logs "requires entitlement … but it is missing" and denies on the
spot — no dialog, no error, status still `.notDetermined`. A grant saved before the hardened runtime
arrived keeps working, since `tccd` does not re-check it, which is why this surfaces only on fresh
installs. Adding a protected resource therefore means adding its usage string *and* its entitlement.

`RESOURCE_ENTITLEMENTS` in `Scripts/verify-signature.sh` maps every protected resource's usage string
to its entitlement, including resources Blitz does not use. That grants nothing — only
`Blitz.entitlements` does, and a row whose usage string `Info.plist` doesn't declare is skipped. It
is there so a future feature that adds the usage string but forgets the entitlement fails the release
instead of shipping a prompt that can never appear.

Nothing else is needed: the only `dlopen` is Apple's own IOBluetooth, so library validation is left
on, and `node`, `ray` and shell commands are separate processes it never reaches. Bluetooth has no
hardened-runtime entitlement.

`./Scripts/verify-signature.sh <path-to-.app>` asserts all of this — the runtime flag on the app *and*
on `Contents/Helpers/ClipboardTextHelper`, an intact nested seal, no `get-task-allow`, and an
entitlement for every usage string `Info.plist` declares. The release job runs it before notarizing:
a nested binary missing the runtime flag is the most common notarization rejection, and a usage string
missing its entitlement ships a permission that can never be granted.

## Quarantine

Releases are notarized and stapled, so Gatekeeper opens a downloaded copy without an `xattr` step,
and Sparkle installs updates without one too.
