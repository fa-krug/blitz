# Updates

Blitz checks this repo's GitHub Releases once a day, offers the newest release in a native window
with its release notes, installs it and relaunches. There is no Sparkle and no appcast: the public
release list is the feed.

## Invariants

- **The archive is a zip, never the DMG.** A zip expands with `ditto`; a DMG would have to be mounted,
  which means a volume, a Spotlight handle and a detach that can fail. A release published without a
  zip is not installable and is not offered.
- **The zip is chosen by architecture.** A release carries one `-Universal-` zip, which every Mac
  takes. Intel is offered *nothing* without one, since a thin build would install and then refuse to
  launch; Apple silicon would prefer a thin zip if a release ever carried one.
- **Nobody runs `xattr` after the first install.** An archive Blitz fetched itself is not quarantined — macOS sets
  that flag for sandboxed downloaders and for apps that opt in with `LSFileQuarantineEnabled`, and
  Blitz is neither. `Quarantine` checks anyway through `getxattr`/`removexattr` rather than the
  `xattr` tool, and an app that still carries the flag is refused rather than installed.
- **The signature is the only integrity guarantee.** A downloaded bundle is trusted when its seal
  validates, nested helper included, *and* it either satisfies the Developer ID requirement pinned in
  `BundleSignature` or carries the byte-identical leaf certificate the running app does. The
  requirement names team `HS26J3YA63`, so a certificate renewal strands nobody. Releases are
  self-signed for now, so today every update passes through the leaf match; the requirement is
  already in place so that a later switch to Developer ID reaches every installed copy. `notarized`
  is deliberately not in the requirement — it resolves the ticket through `syspolicyd` or the
  network, so an offline Mac would refuse a bundle the chain already proves is ours.
- **A build only ever updates within its own channel.** The channels are separate bundle ids installed
  side by side; crossing would mean installing a different app. `de.fa-krug.blitz.dev` never updates
  at all, and does not advertise the command.
- **Nothing is installed unless every check passes.** Bundle id, version and signature are all checked
  on the expanded copy before `replaceItemAt` runs, and the running app survives any failure untouched.
- **Relaunching goes through `NSApp.terminate`, never `exit`.** That is what flushes a pending note
  draft and hands back the Hyper Key's HID-level caps remap, which outlives the process.
- **An automatic prompt defers to whatever the user is doing, and is never spent unshown.**
  `UpdateReadiness` withholds it while a snippet is expanding, an extension command is running, an
  uninstall is trashing, a shortcut is being recorded, a prompt or dialog is up, or the palette is
  open. A withheld prompt is still owed: `presentIfAvailable` answers `false`, the version is left
  unannounced, and the pump re-offers it every two minutes for half an hour before falling back to
  the daily rhythm. That is what a hand-launched copy depends on — its one announcement falls 30 s
  in, straight into the palette the user opened the app to use, where a launch-at-login copy would
  have found the desktop idle. The window itself still appears at most once per version per launch:
  `announcedVersion` is set the moment an offer lands, so re-offering can never turn into nagging.
  Readiness is asked again at the click.
- **Nothing about updates is persisted in `AppSettings`.** The feature owns one cache file, so no
  `AppSettingsKey` and no `SettingsBackupCoverage` entry exist for it.
- **The window shows the changelog and nothing else.** A body may carry install instructions below
  `<!-- blitz:install -->`, and `ReleaseNotes.summary` — the single reader of that marker, called
  where the feed is parsed so the cache holds the cut text too — drops them. CI publishes GitHub's
  generated changelog without the marker, so it comes back whole.
- **The notes are laid out by `ReleaseNotesView`, which is this feature's own.** `AttributedString`
  parses inline styling only; headings and bullets are placed by hand or they arrive as literal `##`
  and `*`. `ExtensionMarkdownView` does the same job and is deliberately not reused — an extension's
  views never leave `Features/Extensions/`.
- **`@handle` and `#304` are linked by the app, never by the release body.** GitHub autolinks both on
  the web, and a bare mention is what notifies the contributor, so the published body keeps them
  plain and `ReleaseNotes` spells them as Markdown links on the way to the window. Both point at
  `ReleaseFeed.repository`, the one place the repo is named.

## Channel and version

`ReleaseChannel` is derived from the bundle id, and nothing else:

| Bundle id | Channel | Takes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `de.fa-krug.blitz` | `.stable` | releases |
| `de.fa-krug.blitz.beta` | `.beta` | prereleases |
| anything else | `.development` | nothing |

`release.yml` publishes stable releases only, so no beta build exists today; the row is the
updater's, inherited from Tinycast, and costs nothing until one does.

`AppVersion` parses `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.N` with semver precedence: a
prerelease sorts below the release it leads to, and `beta.10` above `beta.9`. Everything else parses
to nil, so an off-shape tag can never be offered as an update. A release whose tag disagrees with
its `prerelease` flag is treated as mis-published and skipped.

Intel is *not* a channel. Every release is one universal build under the stable tag, version, bundle
id and signature, so an Intel Mac resolves to `.stable` like any other; `ReleaseArchitecture` picks
the asset, and nothing about identity changes.

## Checking

`UpdateCheckStore` copies `CurrencyRateStore`: a private `.ephemeral`, `urlCache = nil` session, a
self-rescheduling pump, and one atomic JSON file.

```text
~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/update-check.json
```

It holds `lastCheckedAt`, the newest release seen, and the version the user dismissed. Freshness is
measured from `lastCheckedAt`, so relaunching never re-asks GitHub; the interval is 24 h, dropping to
2 h after a failed attempt, and the first check waits 30 s so it never lands in the login rush. The
request carries a `User-Agent`, which the GitHub API rejects requests without.

**Later means skip.** It records the version, so that release stops asking; a newer one still asks.
Check for Updates ignores the record and always offers whatever is newer than what is running.

## Installing

One route, whatever the install came from:

1. Stream the zip into `~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/Updates/`, with real byte progress and a Cancel
   that actually aborts the transfer.
2. `ditto -x -k` it into a staging folder, and take whatever `.app` lands there — the bundle is named
   for its channel, so it is `Blitz Beta.app` on beta.
3. Check quarantine natively; clear it if somehow present, and refuse the update if it survives.
4. Verify the bundle id, the version, and that the code signature is valid and proves the bundle is
   ours — by the pinned Developer ID requirement, or by the running app's own leaf certificate.
5. `FileManager.replaceItemAt`. The staging folder is on the same volume as `/Applications`, which is
   what lets this be atomic. A non-writable `/Applications` is reported, not worked around; there is
   no privileged helper.
6. Offer Relaunch, which spawns a detached waiter that reopens the app once this process exits —
   `open` on a bundle id that is still running would only re-activate the instance on its way out.

Nothing here touches `~/Library/Preferences`, `~/Library/Caches` or `Application Support`, so no
setting, clipboard entry, note or snippet is affected by an update.

## Releasing into it

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on every push to `main` and publishes one asset,
`Blitz-Universal-<version>.zip`, under the tag `v<version>`. The version is `MAJOR.MINOR` from
`project.yml` with the workflow's run number as the patch, so every release is strictly newer than
the last and is never a prerelease. The zip is made with

```sh
ditto -c -k --keepParent --sequesterRsrc "$APP" "dist/$ZIP_FILE"
```

which is the only zip that leaves the code signature verifiable — plain `zip` drops symlinks and
breaks the seal, and the signature check above would then reject every update. The release body is
GitHub's generated changelog. See [release.md](../release.md).
